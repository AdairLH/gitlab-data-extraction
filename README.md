# GitLab Data Extraction: ETL Pipeline to a Dimensional Data Warehouse

[![GitHub Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/releases-download-blue?logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/AdairLH/gitlab-data-extraction/releases)

![GitLab Logo](https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/logo/png/gitlab-icon-rgb.png)

A Python tool that pulls data from GitLab using the GitLab API and maps it straight into a dimensional data model. This tool fills a data mart with facts and dimensions for analytics. It captures issues, projects, users, milestones, and labels, and is designed to slot into an ETL pipeline that serves a data warehouse.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

This project provides a lightweight, auditable path from GitLab data to a dimensional model. It uses the GitLab API (including GraphQL where helpful) and Python requests to extract data, transform it into a star/snowflake schema, and load it into a target data store. The result is a clean set of facts and dimensions ready for reporting and analysis.

Why build this? You want fast, repeatable access to GitLab metrics. You want to support dashboards, BI reports, and data science workflows without custom ad-hoc scripts. You want a repeatable ETL pattern that you can extend.

Key ideas:
- Data is pulled from GitLab on a schedule or on demand.
- Data is shaped into facts (measurable events) and dimensions (context).
- The pipeline feeds a data mart, enabling fast analytics and simple joins.
- The approach favors clarity, traceability, and maintainability.

---

## üîß Core Capabilities

- Data sources: GitLab projects, issues, milestones, users, and labels.
- API access: GitLab REST API and GraphQL when needed.
- Data modeling: Dimensional modeling with facts and dimensions.
- ETL pattern: Extract, Transform, Load into a data warehouse schema.
- Extensibility: Easy to add more entities or new metrics.
- Observability: Clean logs and error reports for debugging.

---

## üß© Data Model and Architecture

This project centers on a dimensional model. The model uses:
- Facts: quantitative measures and events (for example, IssueFact, TimeSpentFact, etc.).
- Dimensions: context for those measures (DimUser, DimProject, DimLabel, DimMilestone, DimTime, etc.).

A typical star schema structure looks like:
- Fact tables: IssueFact, MilestoneFact, LabelUsageFact, ProjectFact
- Dimension tables: DimUser, DimProject, DimLabel, DimMilestone, DimTime

This structure supports fast aggregations and straightforward BI queries. The data model emphasizes:
- Temporal accuracy: time dimensions capture the when of events.
- Consistency: surrogate keys unify entities across facts.
- Traceability: every fact links back to its dimensions with clear FK relationships.

ASCII schematic (simplified):
- TimeDim (DateKey) -> connects to Fact tables
- DimUser (UserKey) -> used by IssueFact, MilestoneFact
- DimProject (ProjectKey) -> used by all facts
- DimMilestone (MilestoneKey) -> used in milestone-related analytics
- DimLabel (LabelKey) -> label-based analytics
- Fact tables:
  - IssueFact (IssueKey, ProjectKey, UserKey, MilestoneKey, TimeKey, MetricFacts...)
  - MilestoneFact (MilestoneKey, ProjectKey, TimeKey, Metrics...)
  - LabelUsageFact (LabelKey, IssueKey, TimeKey, Metrics...)

The model remains adaptable. If you need a new metric, you can add a new fact or extend an existing dimension with a minimal set of changes.

## üß™ Data Extraction and Transformation

What gets pulled:
- Projects: metadata, dates, status, membership.
- Issues: status, creation/update times, assignees, milestones, labels.
- Milestones: name, due dates, progress indicators.
- Users: profiles, roles, activity metrics.
- Labels: names and usage.

What happens:
- Extraction: gather data via GitLab APIs. Pagination and rate limits are respected.
- Transformation: map GitLab fields to dimensional keys. Validate data types and normalize on dates.
- Loading: push to the target data warehouse in an append-only or upsert-friendly manner.

How mapping works:
- Each GitLab entity is translated to its corresponding dimension or fact.
- Entities reference surrogate keys in dimension tables to form a consistent, query-friendly model.
- Time data is normalized into a Time dimension to enable spline and trend analyses.

Data quality and validation:
- Row counts per run are compared to previous runs to detect regressions.
- Null checks ensure essential keys exist (e.g., ProjectKey, UserKey).
- Referential integrity checks confirm fact-to-dimension links are valid.

---

## üß† Data Model Details

Dimensions:
- DimTime: DateKey, Year, Quarter, Month, Day, Weekday, IsWeekend

## üß≠ ETL Process: Step-by-Step

1) Extract
- The extractor calls the GitLab API for the selected projects.
- It handles pagination and respects rate limits.
- It fetches entities in a consistent order to ensure reproducibility.

2) Transform
- Data is mapped to the dimensional model.
- Dates are normalized; time zones are aligned with the Time dimension.
- Foreign keys are assigned for all dimension relationships.

3) Load
- Insert into the data warehouse with appropriate locking and batching.
- Upsert or truncate-and-load strategies can be configured.
- Metadata is updated to reflect the latest load time.

4) Validate
- Check row counts and key integrity.
- Validate the presence of essential dimension keys in facts.
- Produce a lightweight health report containing status and metrics.

5) Schedule (optional)
- Integrations with cron or a workflow manager help run the pipeline on a cadence.
- Logs and metrics are emitted for visibility.

- HTTP library: requests (and GraphQL when appropriate)
- Data modeling: dimensional modeling concepts (facts and dimensions)
- Data storage: any supported data warehouse or storage system
- Optional: Airflow, Dagster, or cron for scheduling
- Documentation: Markdown with clear examples
- Observability: structured logs, simple health checks

The setup favors readability and extensibility. You can swap components if your environment requires a different API strategy or a different target store.

---

## üß≠ API and Integrations

GitLab API usage is central to this project. Consider the following:
- REST API: used to fetch project metadata, issues, milestones, and other entities.
- GraphQL: used for complex queries with precise data shapes and efficient pagination.
- Rate limits: the tool includes basic handling to avoid hitting API rate limits.
- Authentication: token-based authentication to secure access.

Important integration notes:
- For large GitLab instances, GraphQL can reduce the number of requests.
- REST endpoints remain useful for straightforward data retrieval.

---

## üîí Security and Access Control

- Tokens should be stored securely and rotated regularly.
- The configuration should not be checked into version control with credentials.
- Use a secrets manager or environment isolation in your deployment.
- Access to the data warehouse should follow the principle of least privilege.

---

## üß™ Testing and Quality Assurance

- Unit tests cover the data mapping logic and the transformation functions.
- Integration tests validate end-to-end extraction from a test GitLab instance.
- Smoke tests confirm the ability to connect to both GitLab and the data warehouse.
- Data quality checks validate counts, nulls, and referential integrity.

Test strategy aims to be lightweight yet meaningful. It focuses on deterministic behavior and reproducible results.

---

## üö¶ Deployment and Scheduling

- Local runs are great for development and validation.
- For production, consider a scheduler:
  - Cron for simple schedules
  - Airflow/Dipeline-like tools for complex workflows
- Deploy in a controlled environment with monitoring and alerting.

Operational notes:
- Logging: structured and timestamped logs for each run.
- Metrics: simple counters for extracted records and loaded records.
- Alerts: notify when a run fails or when data quality checks fail.

---

## üß≠ Observability and Monitoring

- Logs provide visibility into API usage, transformation decisions, and load status.
- Simple dashboards can show:
  - API call counts per run
  - Rows loaded per entity
  - Time spent in extract/transform/load
  - Health status per run
- You can attach a basic health check endpoint or a small status page in your infrastructure.
